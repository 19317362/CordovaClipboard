Clipboard
=========

Clipboard management plugin for Cordova/PhoneGap.

Notes:
- The only supported platform at the moment is iOS.
- The plugin can only be used with text content.

## Usage

Install the plugin using the CLI, for instance with PhoneGap:

	phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/VersoSolutions/CordovaClipboard

The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.clipboard` with the methods `copy(text)` and `paste(callback)`.

Example:

	var data = "Hello World!";

	window.plugins.copy(data);

	window.plugins.paste(function (data) { alert(data); });

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is based on [ClipboardManagerPlugin](https://github.com/jacob/ClipboardManagerPlugin) (Android) and [ClipboardPlugin](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/ClipboardPlugin) (iOS).
